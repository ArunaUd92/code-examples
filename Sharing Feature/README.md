# SwiftUI Task List with Sharing Feature

This SwiftUI-based iOS application allows users to manage a task list and share individual tasks via various platforms such as social media, email, or messaging apps using UIActivityViewController. Users can select a task from the list and share it through the built-in sharing sheet in iOS.

## Features

- **Task List**: Displays a list of tasks with descriptions and completion status.
- **Task Sharing**: Users can share individual tasks via email, messages, social media, and more using the system share sheet.
- **Custom Design**: Includes a floating action button (FAB) for adding new tasks, and a clean, simple UI with rounded task cards.
- **Offline Caching**: Caches tasks for offline access (optional).
