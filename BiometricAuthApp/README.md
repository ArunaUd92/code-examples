# BiometricAuthApp

BiometricAuthApp is a simple SwiftUI application that demonstrates how to implement biometric authentication (Face ID or Touch ID) using the `LocalAuthentication` framework in iOS. The app restricts access to secure content until the user successfully authenticates using biometrics.

## Features

- **Biometric Authentication**: Secure access to app content using Face ID or Touch ID.
- **SwiftUI**: Built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern UI framework for building apps across all Apple platforms.
- **Reactive UI**: Automatically updates the UI based on the user's authentication status.

## Requirements

- **iOS 14.0** or later
- **Xcode 12** or later
- **Device with Face ID or Touch ID** (iPhone 8 or later recommended)
