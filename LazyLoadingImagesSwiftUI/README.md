# LazyLoadingImagesSwiftUI

This iOS application demonstrates how to implement lazy loading for images using SwiftUI. The app fetches and displays images from the internet, loading them only when needed, which optimizes performance when dealing with a large number of images. The app also simulates a big data scenario by processing a large set of image URLs.

## Features

- **Lazy Loading of Images**: Images are loaded on-demand as the user scrolls through the list, improving performance and reducing memory usage.
- **Image Caching**: Downloaded images are cached using `NSCache` to prevent redundant network requests and to enhance the app's responsiveness.
- **Big Data Simulation**: The app simulates handling a large dataset by processing and displaying 1,000 images with random URLs.
- **SwiftUI and Combine**: The app is built using modern SwiftUI and Combine frameworks, offering a reactive and declarative approach to UI and data handling.
