# Multiple Sorting Criteria and Filtering

This is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to manage a list of tasks with complex sorting, filtering, and dynamic UI updates. The app includes customizable sorting options, the ability to filter tasks by completion status and category, and a colorful, animated user interface for an enhanced experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI**: Tasks are displayed in a visually appealing list, with colors indicating task categories and priorities. Task completion is animated for a smoother user experience.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed/incomplete with a single tap, with visual feedback provided by a checkmark icon.
- **Category Segmentation**: Tasks can be filtered by category, with segmented control to switch between categories.
- **Task Prioritization**: Task size is color-coded to show priority levels.
- **Add New Tasks**: Add new tasks to the list with a simple tap on the plus button.
